Qutb Minar and its Monuments, Delhi, located to the south of Delhi,
is a complex with the Qutb Minar as the centre piece, which is a red
sandstone tower of 72.5 metres (238 ft) height with a base of 14.32
metres (47.0 ft) reducing to 2.75 metres (9.0 ft) diameter at the top.
Built in the beginning of the 13th century, the complex of structures
comprises itineraries, the Alai Darwaza Gate (1311), the Alai Minar
(an incomplete mound of the intended Minar or tower), the QubbatulIslam
Mosque (the earliest existing mosque in India), the tomb of
Iltumish, and an Iron Pillar. The complex is a testimony to the
Islamic depredations during the period as seen from the materials
used for building the complex which are those that were removed
after destroying Hindu and Jain temples; a shining iron pillar of 7.02
metres (23.0 ft) height (without any trace of rusting) erected at the
centre of the complex, with inscriptions in Sanskrit, of the Chandra
Gupta II period is a moot witness. History records its construction,
initially by Qutubuddin Aibak in 1192, its completion by Iltumish
(1211–36) and again by Alauddin Khalji (1296–1316). It underwent
several renovations by subsequent rulers, following damage to the
structures due to lightning. It was inscribed under the UNESCO
World Heritage List under category iv for its unique representation
of the Islamic architectural and artistic excellence.
