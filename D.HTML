Red Fort Complex, also known as Lal Qila is a palace fort built in
the 17th century by Shahjahan (1628–58), the fifth Mughal emperor
as part of his new capital city of Shahjahanabad. located to the north
of Delhi. It represents the glory of the Mughal rule and is considered
the Highpoint of Mughal architectural, artistic aesthetic creativity.
The architectural design of the structures built within the fort
represents a blend of Persian, Timuri and Indian architectural styles;
Isfahan, the Persian Capital is said to have provided the inspiration
to build the Red Fort Complex. The planning and design of this
complex, in a geometrical grid plan with pavilion structures, was the
precursor of several monuments which were built later in Rajasthan,
Delhi, Agra and other places. The palace complex has been fortified
by an enclosure wall built with red sand stone (hence the name Red
Fort). It is adjacent to the Salimgarh Fort on its north built by Islam
Shah Suri in 1546 and is now part of the Red Fort Complex (area
covered 120 acres) under the revised inscription of the UNESCO
World Heritage List under categories (i),(ii), (iii) and (vi). Built
between 1639 and 1648, enclosing an area of size 656 metres
(2,152 ft)x328 metres (1,076 ft) and raising to a height of 23 metres
(75 ft) on the right bank of the Yamuna River, it is linked to the
Salimgarh Fort through a bridge over an old river channel, now a city
road. The palace within the fort complex, located behind the DiwaniAm
(Hall of Public Audience), comprises a series of richly engraved
marble palace pavilions, interconnected by water channels called the
‘NehriBehishit’
meaning the “Stream of Paradise”, the Diwaneikhas
(Private audience hall), several other essential private
structures, and also the Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque built by Emperor
Aurangzeb).
